## Personal Bio

I’m a beauty entrepreneur, data science student, and former finance professional—passionate about creating products that help women feel seen, confident, and celebrated.

After several years working in mutual funds and investment services, I took a bold step into entrepreneurship, founding a luxury wig and hair extensions brand rooted in quality, care, and culture. What started as a creative passion quickly grew into a business where I now oversee everything from sourcing and product development to marketing and customer experience.

I'm currently pursuing a Master’s in Data Science at the University of Essex, where I’m learning to apply data-driven insights to business decisions—from understanding customer behavior to forecasting trends and optimizing operations.

This e-portfolio is a reflection of my journey—past, present, and what's still ahead. Whether it's beauty, business, or data, I’m always building with purpose.
