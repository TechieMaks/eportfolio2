# Professional Bio

I'm an entrepreneur and founder in the luxury wig and hair extensions industry, building a premium brand that blends craftsmanship, confidence, and culture. With a background in finance and mutual funds, I bring a unique perspective to business—combining analytical rigor with creative vision to grow a brand rooted in quality and trust.

Before launching my wig business, I built a career in financial services, where I managed investment portfolios and client relationships with precision and care. This experience sharpened my skills in strategic planning, operations, and client engagement—all of which now fuel my approach to product development, sales, and brand building.

Today, I lead every aspect of my business, from sourcing and design to marketing and customer service, with a clear focus: empowering women through beauty that feels as good as it looks. 
I’m passionate about entrepreneurship, innovation in the beauty industry, and creating products that make women feel seen and celebrated.
